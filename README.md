# simulating-ball-movement

The task is to make the ball continuously move from the left of the page to the right.

To complete this task, do the following:

Declare a global variable called velocity and set its value to 100. This variable controls the speed at which the ball moves across the page.
Declare another global variable called positionX. This variable represents the position of the ball on the x-axis. The value of this variable should initially be 0.
Inside the moveBall() function, add logic to update the positionX variable by adding the value of velocity to it. Then set the ball's position to this new value.
After making these changes, the ball should move from left to right continuously.
